Oh Snap! is a web application that allows users to see curated images based on the weather and time in the city of their choice. 

## Description

Oh Snap! is an application that combines the weather, time, and location to allow users to enjoy images and enhance their mood. Images have an effect on people, that we at Oh Snap! believe can help to enhance our mornings, days, and nights. Oh Snap! utilizes the OpenWeather API and the Unsplash API in combination with an intuitive user interface to bring up images that, using our algorithm, strategically connects the weather, the city, and the time of day, to bring curated images to your phone. The user can easily simply refresh the page for a set of new images or input another city to view images related to those places. Oh Snap! is optimized for IPhone X, but is compatible with most browsers.
